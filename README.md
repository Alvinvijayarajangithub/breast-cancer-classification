# breast-cancer-classification
This project focuses on applying supervised machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer cases as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using the Breast Cancer Dataset from the sklearn library. The goal is to evaluate the performance of different classification algorithms and identify the best model for this problem.
